### Julius's City

In contrast to my little yellow square, Julius's everyday experience of New York City is one of wandering. He finds himself in places all across the city, interacting with random people and observing interesting attractions like the International Center for Photography or the American Folk Art Museum. The locations on the map are not even a comprehensive list of the places Julius goes during HOW TO ITALICIZE Open City; they are just some of the more notable ones. His knowledge of the city is deep, and he seems to know where he is in relation to other important places at all times. I, on the other hand, constantly get turned around and confused, and for a while I couldn't even identify the Empire State Building. There's been a question in the back of my mind: no matter how long you live in a place, if you lived in it without knowing it, then did you ever truly live in it at all?
