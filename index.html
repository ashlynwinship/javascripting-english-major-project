  <section class="tab-pane active" id="my-city" role="tabpanel"><h4>My City</h4>A while back, I read an article that discussed a college student who was studying abroad in Paris. This student travelled back and forth mainly between three locations, and these three locations were mundane places like her classes, her workplace, and her home. Despite the fact that she was in an exciting city like Paris, she spent most of her time within this triangle. This bothered me.
  I think that it got to me because I have a tendency to do the same thing. Although I'm in New York City, I spend most of my time in the yellow area on the map. I travel between Washington Square Park (where my classes are), Palladium (where the pool is, so I can dive), and Founders Hall (where I live). The derives allowed me to get away from my main area a little bit.
  Considering my little square of activity in comparison to Julius's wandering, I feel like I'm not doing enough with my time here in the city. I arrived here, figured out exactly where I needed to go to get the daily necessities done, and stuck to those places. Julius wanders regularly, and finds himself much more spread out across the map than I do. A few times I've asked my friends to go with me to places, like the Botanical Gardens in the Bronx to see a glass sculpture exhibit, or the Rockefeller Center to watch the tree lighting. One time a friend and I walked the entire length of the High Line, both ways. The derives, too, took me to new places. But aside from occasional excursions, most of my time in the city is spent in the same few locations. I'd like to change it up a bit.<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VsqAgXS.jpg" height=200px></img></section>

    <h3 id="question">What does it mean to live in a city?</h3>
    <p id="question-answers">It's highly unlikely that anyone could ever <em>completely</em> know New York City. But if you spend your time in the city completely oblivious to everything except your necessities, can you claim to know it at all? If you take the N train to work every day but can't speak with any knowledge about the stops beyond your own, or if you walk home on University to 12th Street and have no idea what might be on 13th, then you're not really living in New York City. You're living in your <em>own</em> city. When Julius walks around, he pays attention to his surroundings and incorporates them into his city. He combines his own thoughts with facts about the history of different places in order to give meaning to the areas of the city that he passes through. Many of us, however, walk by these places without even seeing them. But more than that, we walk by these places without having the faintest of ideas about what other people associate with them. We walk around New York City unaware of what it means to other people, and unaware that any version of the city other than our own could exist. This is one area in which Julius fails: while he may have a rich experience of his New York City, he has absolutely no clue what the city means to other people.</p>

    <p id="next-to-text"><h3>Worm's Eye View</h3>Perspective is the most important thing when looking at this city. Focus on the background of this picture and you're looking at Jersey City. Focus on the water, and you're seeing the Hudson River. But if you train your eyes on what's actually in focus in this shot, you'll see the ground on our side of the Hudson, in New York City. Half the time that I'm looking at Jersey City, I'm not even aware that what I'm seeing isn't NYC. Our versions of the city get so easily twisted up in what we expect to see, or what we think we're seeing, that we forget to notice what's actually in our immediate area.</p>
