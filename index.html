  <section class="tab-pane active" id="my-city" role="tabpanel"><h4>My City</h4>A while back, I read an article that discussed a college student who was studying abroad in Paris. This student travelled back and forth mainly between three locations, and these three locations were mundane places like her classes, her workplace, and her home. Despite the fact that she was in an exciting city like Paris, she spent most of her time within this triangle. This bothered me.
  I think that it got to me because I have a tendency to do the same thing. Although I'm in New York City, I spend most of my time in the yellow area on the map. I travel between Washington Square Park (where my classes are), Palladium (where the pool is, so I can dive), and Founders Hall (where I live). The derives allowed me to get away from my main area a little bit.
  Considering my little square of activity in comparison to Julius's wandering, I feel like I'm not doing enough with my time here in the city. I arrived here, figured out exactly where I needed to go to get the daily necessities done, and stuck to those places. Julius wanders regularly, and finds himself much more spread out across the map than I do. A few times I've asked my friends to go with me to places, like the Botanical Gardens in the Bronx to see a glass sculpture exhibit, or the Rockefeller Center to watch the tree lighting. One time a friend and I walked the entire length of the High Line, both ways. The derives, too, took me to new places. But aside from occasional excursions, most of my time in the city is spent in the same few locations. I'd like to change it up a bit.

  <section class="tab-pane" id="derive1" role="tabpanel"><h4>Derive 1</h4>My first derive was the first time that I went to Hudson River Park. The app I was using to give me instructions about where to wander said "Head west," so westward I went. I saw the water and went straight for it, and then proceeded to spend a good chunk of time wandering around Piers 40 and 45. When I left the water I wandered along West Street in between massive buildings that seemed like warehouses (there were big doors for trucks to come in and out of, so I assumed they were enormous storage facilities). Of course, with my knowledge of the city, I'm probably wrong.
  Either way, there was hardly anybody on the street, in stark contrast to the area around Founders Hall, where there are <em>always</em> people. It was actually eerily quiet, which was pleasant because something that has been bothering me since I got to the city is that it EMP never seems to be quiet, anywhere.On page 54 of EMP Open City, Julius wonders, "Where in this riverine city could one fully sense a riverbank?" This quote has stuck with me. My surprise upon glimpsing the Hudson a few blocks away at the start of the derive really points to how easy it is to forget about the rivers. It took me a long time to realize that I can see the East River from my window on the 25th floor of Founders Hall.

  <section class="tab-pane" id="derive2" role="tabpanel"><h4>Derive 2</h4>At the beginning of my second derive, I found myself unexpectedly in TriBeCa (that's how unfamiliar I am with the city). After stumbling upon the World Trade Center Memorial and discovering the Oculus, I made my way toward St. Paul's Chapel. The Oculus was very strange to me, because I didn't know it was a mall and I thought it looked like some kind of sea creature. The chapel was beautiful, although I couldn't go inside because it was under construction, and it seemed kind of out of place in the middle of the glassy, affluent area of the city in which I'd found myself. Weeks later, my friend and I went on a walk, and we ended up taking the subway downtown to the same area. I took him to the Oculus and we actually went down into it, which I hadn't done on my derive. It was very white and very quiet, and everything seemed very expensive.
  The atmosphere changed drastically somewhere in between the Union Square station and the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station, just a single stop away from each other. Because I took the subway and didn't walk, I didn't get to see it happen gradually, so when I stepped out of the station I was shocked. I was clearly in a wealthy area, and I hadn't expected to be. The buildings were gorgeous, and the lighter-colored concrete and the sun reflecting off of all the glass gave the whole area a distinct impression of being much more full of light than the East Village. The distinct contrast reminded me that my area of the city is not the only area, and that even just one train stop away, the city can be very different.

  <section class="tab-pane" id="julius-city" role="tabpanel"><h4>Julius's City</h4>In contrast to my little yellow square, Julius's everyday experience of New York City is one of wandering. He finds himself in places all across the city, interacting with random people and observing interesting attractions like the International Center for Photography or the American Folk Art Museum. The locations on this map are not even a comprehensive list of the places Julius goes during <em>Open City;</em> they are just some of the more notable ones. His knowledge of the city is deep, and he seems to know where he is in relation to other important places at all times. I, on the other hand, constantly get turned around and confused, and for a while I couldn't even identify the Empire State Building. There's been a question in the back of my mind: no matter how long you live in a place, if you lived in it without knowing it, then did you ever truly live in it at all?

    <h3 id="question">What does it mean to live in a city?</h3>
    <p id="question-answers">It's highly unlikely that anyone could ever <em>completely</em> know New York City. But if you spend your time in the city completely oblivious to everything except your necessities, can you claim to know it at all? If you take the N train to work every day but can't speak with any knowledge about the stops beyond your own, or if you walk home on University to 12th Street and have no idea what might be on 13th, then you're not really living in New York City. You're living in your <em>own</em> city. When Julius walks around, he pays attention to his surroundings and incorporates them into his city. He combines his own thoughts with facts about the history of different places in order to give meaning to the areas of the city that he passes through. Many of us, however, walk by these places without even seeing them. But more than that, we walk by these places without having the faintest of ideas about what other people associate with them. We walk around New York City unaware of what it means to other people, and unaware that any version of the city other than our own could exist. This is one area in which Julius fails: while he may have a rich experience of his New York City, he has absolutely no clue what the city means to other people.</p>

    <p id="next-to-text"><h3>Worm's Eye View</h3>Perspective is the most important thing when looking at this city. Focus on the background of this picture and you're looking at Jersey City. Focus on the water, and you're seeing the Hudson River. But if you train your eyes on what's actually in focus in this shot, you'll see the ground on our side of the Hudson, in New York City. Half the time that I'm looking at Jersey City, I'm not even aware that what I'm seeing isn't NYC. Our versions of the city get so easily twisted up in what we expect to see, or what we think we're seeing, that we forget to notice what's actually in our immediate area.</p>
