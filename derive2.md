### Derive 2

At the beginning of my second derive, I found myself unexpectedly in TriBeCa (that's how unfamiliar I am with the city). After stumbling upon the World Trade Center Memorial and discovering the Oculus, I made my way toward St. Paul's Chapel. The Oculus was very strange to me, because I didn't know it was a mall and I thought it looked like some kind of sea creature. The chapel was beautiful, although I couldn't go inside because it was under construction, and it seemed kind of out of place in the middle of the glassy, affluent area of the city in which I'd found myself. Weeks later, my friend and I went on a walk, and we ended up taking the subway downtown to the same area. I took him to the Oculus and we actually went down into it, which I hadn't done on my derive. It was very white and very quiet, and everything seemed very expensive.
The atmosphere changed drastically somewhere in between the Union Square station and the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station, just a single stop away from each other. Because I took the subway and didn't walk, I didn't get to see it happen gradually, so when I stepped out of the station I was shocked. I was clearly in a wealthy area, and I hadn't expected to be. The buildings were gorgeous, and the lighter-colored concrete and the sun reflecting off of all the glass gave the whole area a distinct impression of being much more full of light than the East Village. The distinct contrast reminded me that my area of the city is not the only area, and that even just one train stop away, the city can be very different.
