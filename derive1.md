### Derive 1

My first derive was the first time that I went to Hudson River Park. The app I was using to give me instructions about where to wander said "Head west," so westward I went. I saw the water and went straight for it, and then proceeded to spend a good chunk of time wandering around Piers 40 and 45. When I left the water I wandered along West Street in between massive buildings that seemed like warehouses (there were big doors for trucks to come in and out of, so I assumed they were enormous storage facilities). Of course, with my knowledge of the city, I'm probably wrong.
Either way, there was hardly anybody on the street, in stark contrast to the area around Founders Hall, where there are EMPHASIZE always people. It was actually eerily quiet, which was pleasant because something that has been bothering me since I got to the city is that it EMP never seems to be quiet, anywhere.
On page 54 of EMP Open City, Julius wonders, "Where in this riverine city could one fully sense a riverbank?" This quote has stuck with me. My surprise upon glimpsing the Hudson a few blocks away at the start of the derive really points to how easy it is to forget about the rivers. It took me a long time to realize that I can see the East River from my window on the 25th floor of Founders Hall.
