### My City

A while back, I read an article that talked about a college student who was studying abroad in Paris. This student travelled back and forth mainly between three locations, and these three locations were mundane places, probably her classes, her workplace, and her home. Despite the fact that she was in an exciting city like Paris, she spent most of her time within this triangle. This bothered me.
I think that it got to me because I have a tendency to do the same thing. Although I'm in New York City, I spend most of my time in the yellow area on the map. I travel between Washington Square Park (where my classes are), Palladium (where the pool is, so I can dive), and Founders Hall (where I live). The derives allowed me to get away from my main area a little bit.
Considering my little square of activity in comparison to Julius's wandering,
