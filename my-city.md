### My City

A while back, I read an article that discussed a college student who was studying abroad in Paris. This student travelled back and forth mainly between three locations, and these three locations were mundane places like her classes, her workplace, and her home. Despite the fact that she was in an exciting city like Paris, she spent most of her time within this triangle. This bothered me.
I think that it got to me because I have a tendency to do the same thing. Although I'm in New York City, I spend most of my time in the yellow area on the map. I travel between Washington Square Park (where my classes are), Palladium (where the pool is, so I can dive), and Founders Hall (where I live). The derives allowed me to get away from my main area a little bit.
Considering my little square of activity in comparison to Julius's wandering, I feel like I'm not doing enough with my time here in the city. I arrived here, figured out exactly where I needed to go to get the daily necessities done, and stuck to those places. Julius wanders regularly, and finds himself much more spread out across the map than I do. A few times I've asked my friends to go with me to places, like the Botanical Gardens in the Bronx to see a glass sculpture exhibit, or the Rockefeller Center to watch the tree lighting. One time a friend and I walked the entire length of the High Line, both ways. The derives, too, took me to new places. But aside from occasional excursions, most of my time in the city is spent in the same few locations. I'd like to change it up a bit.
